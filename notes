todo
-----------

- handle args in report and in graphql
- make oterm input screen
 - form based or give up and just prompt for each value
 - input/invoice
  - just use simple readline and prompts

- crud
 - by object - invoice new ...
 - or by op - new invoice ...
  - more consistent with report xxx

 - allow values to be provide like id=INV-20191111
  - if provided they are not prompted for
 - perform consitency checks
  - referenced object exist like accounts, customer, ect

- reports - generic or specific
 - specific
  - easy to get ID for operations on row object
  - can implement things like filtering row for display based on hidden attributes
  - can display items differently, boolean as checkbox for example or images for status
 - generic
  - use same display code
  - need position indicator for ID
  - need alignment indicator for each column
   - basically need to pass more info about the table
 - really come down to how to think about reports, are they generic or each custom

 - list
  - late
  - P&L
